# BlenderModels
Blender models in Blender and glTF 2 format.

Mainly this just serves as a holding area because I'm constantly moving models between computers. This includes a bunch of unfinished models and some render output that I used for my portfolio site. Theres lots of garbage and fluff as well. When this gets too bloated, I'll take my favorite stuff and move it into a new repo and retire this one. 

A lot of the models are things that I created when following tutorials on YouTube, so I'm not claiming any of this as my own IP.

Some of my favorite models are:
